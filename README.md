# Current_Sense_Amplifier-Feedback
A current shunt amplifier circuit to provide feedback for other circuits.<br/>
## Goal:
Develop a current feeback system via current shunt and a amplifier cicuit.
It can be connect to any external circuit.
The specific use of this project is to provide a current feedback to a powerr supply unit to allow limiting current function.

## Requirments:
1. Provie a current feeback proportional to the voltage. (1A = 1V)
2. Acceptable voltage drop accross the current shunt. (0.2V MAX with 2A current)
